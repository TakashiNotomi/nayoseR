\description{
This function launches a Shiny interface for manually approving or rejecting
name matching candidates generated in advance by `match_names_sbert()`.
It loads the `match_result.csv` file and allows the user to interactively
judge the similarity-based matches. The results are saved to `nayose_dict.csv`,
which can be reused for future automatic name matching.
